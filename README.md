Our work aims to develop and utilize the most state-of-the-art information technology algorithms to detect lesions and abnormalities in medical images.
By making the most of Tensorflow Object Detection API, we have made some modifications in the open source code to be suitable with our purposes.
This repository is dedicated for anyone who wants to perform object detection using Faster R-CNN.
Thank you for visitting our lab's github!
